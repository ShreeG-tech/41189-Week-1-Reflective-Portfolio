# My 41189 Reflective Portfolio

## Week 1

### What have I learnt this week?

*This week* I got introduced into the world of systems for this subject, specifically the complex systems that are designed and operated by humans. I learnt about how systems are comprised of multiple elements or parts-and how they are imperative into making the system functional. I also learnt that there are 3 types of systems

- Open which are systems that can cross boundaries to their surrounding environment when transferring energy and matter e.g. ecosystems
- Closed which are systems that send out energy but not matter to their surrounding environment e.g.solar systems
- Isolated are systems that have absolutely no iteractions beyond their boundary layer e.g. controlled laboratory experiments

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

For the most part I knew that systems are made up of elements or parts, and that these components form their structure and function. But what I did not know is that systems mean different things when you apply them to different contexts. There are various examples of systems such as the human body systems, where each organ, cell and tissue is needed to ensure the proper workings-and they all interrelate with other body systems to also ensure that the human stays alive. However, other defnitions of a system involve a set of rules that define one's behaviour and occupation such as hierarchies for example feudal system-which was an ancient system in the Medieval period. Another concept I wasn't aware of is that a system, when you look at it from a holistic perspective, cannot be divided into independent parts without
losing its essence. You can't have one without the other. Everything is interdependent. Inside what looks to be a massive system, are systems within a system. Another interesting concept I wasn't aware of was that a system works in the confines of time and space. There is a place and season for everything we have all been told-and systems are included in that.

### What insights have I gained?

That anything and anyone is a system within themselves. There's a method to the madness. There are so many complexities that contribute a lot to the existence of what we experience on a daily basis. A lot of it is systematic through design such as the microprocessors used in the electronics we use-they're very intricate and complicated as a result, but then there's been a lot of dynamics at play as there are many things we can't design and control like the economy-but we still need it. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

For me, my perceived strengths are that I have an insatiable curiosity to learn the behind the scenes processes of how things and people operate. There is always more to the story than what gets shown to the world. My perceived weaknesses are that learning will never truly be finished as new things, people and concepts will always keep on coming as it should be. The work is never truly done-you just barrel ahead to the next mission or task once you wrap up the previous. Learning like life is never easy, but there is always a way to keep on going-and that I need t strengthen my resolve to keep up with it.

### What were the challenges I encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them? 

Since this is the first week, I haven't faced any challenges as of yet-but I am aware I will be met with them as this term progresses. But I will handle them by starting tasks early, and looking at resources online and asking my classmates, and the lecturer/tutors for help when I need it, as well as learning more in my own time.

### What would I do better next time and with what ancitipated results?

This is the first term and I feel as if I am starting afresh and turning a new page. What I would improve upon is creating a proper study/assessment schedule and abiding by it-whilst also making time for the other important things in my life. As I have aforementioned earlier, starting tasks early and asking for help on time would help me feel less stressed and have greater clarity in completing my assigned tasks. I hope to do better than my previous results-see gradual improvement over time. 

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this? 

The theory I feel that has proved to be most useful is that in the case of systems, complicated and complex do not necessarily mean the same thing. There are different categories to which systems fall under such as
- Obvious (structures are clearly defined and discipline is essential)
- Chaotic (previous plans do not work, the current pattern isn't clear-which makes planning difficult)
- Complicated (systems still have a predictable upfront where the outcome can be determined)
- Complex (on the other hands systems here are unpredictable so their outcome will be undeterminable)

I feel this theory is not only useful in categorising systems-but also in certain aspects of our personal lives. Genetics are things we have no control over and their systems are complex-complicated at best. There are things we do and do not have control over. Our entire school, uni and work schedules are fairly obvious as there are clearly defined structures and discipline is essential to maintain good work ethic to get things done. This way of categorising systems is similar to the OODA loop, which stands for (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act). OODA is a 4 step approach to decision-making that focuses on sorting through the available information, and putting it into the context at hand and efficiently making the most appropriate decision at the time- whilst also comprehending that changes can be made as more data becomes available, making adaptability a necessity. The military uses OODA for their systems as OODA was invented by military strategist,Colonel John Boyd of the US Air Force. I feel modern systems can use this in a fast paced world.
